## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

3 of my favorite applications to use are: Notion, Spotify, and Google Maps

Notion:
1. You can create a database and show it in multiple views
2. It has quick actions using the "/" command

Spotify:
1. It can create new playlists using algorithm to match other liked songs
2. It allows me to connect multiple devices together and allows for jams with friends

Google Maps:
1. It contains an offline maps element so it can work in any place at any time
2. The map contains many layers and you can even drop a pin to see street view

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had difficulty navigating Xcode when I first opened up the IDE. It took a couple minutes to get used to.
